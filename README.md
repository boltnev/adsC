Here are some of my experiments with Algorithms and Data structures. I'll be pleased if someone find here any useful thing. 

Now here:

Sort Algorithms:
	* Bubble sort
	* Insert sort 
	* Select sort 
	* Shell sort(need to select better koefficients)
	* Quicksort
	* Mergesort
Find substring algoritms:
	* Naive 
	* Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
Also here
	* find Median and k-order element in array

Data structures:
	* Cyclic FIFO buffer

Also some supporting things implemented here:
	* Data loader(loads integer values, separated by '\n'(end of line) symbols )
	* Data writer, contrariwise, writes integers to file
	* Random data generator(generates sybols for sort algorithms testing and strings)
